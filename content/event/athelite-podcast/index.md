I had the opportunity to speak with ***The AthElite Podcast*** last year to discuss wearable technology in sport science. Some of the topics we covered included:

- Education
- Global Positioning Systems (GPS) to quantify athlete activity
- My PhD research using Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs)
- Analysing athlete running gait from IMUs
